# HACC 2025 – Git Evidence Report  
Hawaiʻi Enterprise Technology Services IV&V Reporting System  
Repository: `github.com/Seb-08/hacc2025`

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project name:** Hawaiʻi ETS IV&V Reporting System  
**Repository:** `github.com/Seb-08/hacc2025`  
**Tech stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL (Drizzle), API routes, UploadThing, etc.  
**Development period (based on Git history):**  
From **2025-09-09** (initial commit) through **2025-11-16** (latest commits).

This repository contains the full development history of our project for HACC 2025.  
The Git logs show:

- Continuous work over roughly two months  
- Multiple contributors committing under individual accounts  
- Use of feature branches, pull requests, and merges  
- Incremental evolution of features rather than a single mass code dump

Together, this demonstrates that our codebase was developed by our team and not copied from another source.

## 2. Branch & Workflow Overview

### 2.1 Branch Structure

Key branches present in the repository:

- `main` – Primary production branch (`origin/main`)
- `charts` – Charts and visualization work (aligned with `main` in final state)
- `notifications` / `notifacations` – Notification system feature branches
- `prototype` – Early prototype branch, merged back into the main line
- `Form` – Initial form workflow implementation
- `database` – Schema/API updates and hierarchy backend work
- `feature/searchresults` – Search results view and related APIs
- `login` – Authentication and login feature branch
- `month` – Branch associated with licensing / project meta
- Additional branches such as `navbar`, `test`, etc. for UI and experimentation

This branching strategy shows that the team:

- Developed features on separate branches  
- Integrated changes via merges and pull requests  
- Avoided dumping all work directly onto `main` in a single step

(Full raw branch output is included in the Appendix.)

## 4. Development Timeline (High-Level Narrative)

Below is a narrative summary of major development phases, based on the commit messages and dates in the Git log.

### 4.1 Initial Setup (Early September 2025)

- **Initial commit** (`b3d1a85`, 2025-09-09) by `unknown <Seb-08>`:
  - Sets up the Next.js project, Drizzle configuration, database schema scaffolding, global styles, and initial app layout.
- Followed by **test pushes** (e.g., `160b72b`, `a9413c7`) verifying the workflow.
- A `.env` file is added and merged via pull request (`fe1eccd`, `dcbefef`), which shows early coordination using PRs.

### 4.2 Personal Folders & Early UI (Mid/Late September 2025)

- Creation of personal folders and pages for each team member (e.g., `1f52bff` – “9/22 personal folders”).
- Introduction of UI theming and DaisyUI configuration (`9efa75f` – “main 9/22”).
- Multiple branches and pull requests related to early prototypes:
  - `prototype` and other branches are merged (`dafa1c4`, `40062ab`, `2115ac7`).
  - Personal feature branches (e.g., `sebastian`, `loka`) merged via PRs.

This phase shows the team experimenting, setting up UI and structure, and regularly merging via GitHub pull requests.

### 4.3 Database & API Build-Out (Late September – Early October 2025)

- Commit `db09adf` (“database”) introduces:
  - Database integrations in `src/server/db/index.ts`
  - Expanded environment configuration
- Commit `6c78b5a` (“api stuff for new schema”) adds:
  - API routes for `createMonthlyReport`, `departments`, `issues`, `projects`, `schedules`
- Commit `73d4850` (“Upload Thing, Search Bar, and filters”) adds:
  - UploadThing integration
  - Search functionality and filtering
  - Additional DB schema and server logic

At this point, the project transitions from a static UI prototype into a real full-stack app with a data model and endpoints.

### 4.4 UI, Search, and Layout Polishing (Late October 2025)

- Multiple layout and page updates by **Kaila Wallace**:
  - `b8617d5` – Updated page format (homepage)
  - `a6f0538` – Updated layout (10/30)

This period is where the app’s core business logic—forms, reports, authentication, and database—really comes together.

### 4.6 Review Workflow, Snapshots, and Notifications (Mid November 2025)

- **Review flow & snapshot system**:
  - `8b71c70` – “polished 11/6, 8:35pm”: refines `/reports` APIs, form pages, and review-related components.
  - `bcf1a79` – “review n stuff”:
    - Adds Drizzle migrations and metadata
    - Introduces snapshot review APIs (`/review/snapshots`)
    - Implements `review/page.tsx` for the reviewer view
  - `6575339` – “all done”:

    - Improves `reports/view/[id]/page.tsx` and other UI around report review
- **Notifications system**:
  - `d669ebb` – “ui of notifications”: introduces notification UI and `notificationbell` client component.
  - `c7ca34f` – “notifications are functional” (very large commit):
    - Adds or refines:
      - Auth routes (`/api/auth/login`, `/logout`, `/me`)
      - A wide range of `/reports` and `/review` API routes
      - Form pages, review pages, report pages
      - `SignatureModal`, `report-draft-provider`, `report-side-nav`

## 6. Conclusion

Based on the Git history:

1. **Timeline:** Development occurs steadily from early September through mid-November 2025, with commits spread across that period.
2. **Collaboration:** Many distinct authors contribute code, with multiple commits per person.
3. **Workflow:** Work is organized into branches (notifications, search results, login, database, forms, prototype, etc.) and integrated via merges and pull requests.
4. **Incremental evolution:** Key files and features (layout, forms, reports, snapshots, notifications, auth, database schema) evolve step-by-step, with clear insertions and deletions over time.
5. **Transparency:** All commits, authors, branches, and merge points are visible and auditable in the public Git history.

Taken together, this repository provides strong, verifiable evidence that the project was developed organically by our team and not stolen.
